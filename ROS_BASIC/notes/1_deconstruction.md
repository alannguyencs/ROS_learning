# ROS Deconstruction
## Method
1. **DECONSTRUCTION**: we have identified the important parts of ROS that you must master in order to understand 80% of ROS programs. You will concentrate on learning these parts very deep.

1. **REMOVING**: we have removed many things that are not needed and just add noise to your learning.

1. **LEARNING**: we guide you step by step in a progressive manner through all those important parts, starting always from a robot that does things.

1. **PRACTICING**: we make you practice a lot on every step, always on a robot using our simulated robots.

## Example commands:
**Topics**
+ To move `roslaunch publisher_example move.launch`
+ To stop `roslaunch publisher_example stop.launch`

**Services**
+ Service Server side: `roslaunch service_demo service_launch.launch`
+ Service Client side: `rosservice call /service_demo "{}"`

**Actions**
+ Start the action: `roslaunch action_demo action_launch.launch`
+ Call the action: `roslaunch action_demo_client client_launch.launch`

**RViZ**
+ start RViZ: `rosrun rviz rviz`


## Apply what you learnt to a Real Robot Project
As you master the different concepts of ROS, you will have to apply 
everything you learn during the course in a complete robot project. 
And I'm not talking about any kind of robot project, but a project based 
on a real robot which is located in our facilities in Barcelona.

For this purpose, we will be using the [Real Robot Lab](https://app.theconstructsim.com/RealRobot) tool. 
This amazing tool will allow you to remotely control and run your 
ROS programs, from any place of the world, in a real robot.

But that's not all! After you complete the real robot project, 
you will have the chance to do a live presentation of your project.
